# Sass

All the Sass-files are seperated in variables (sass-variables), modules and components.

## Modules
With modules, concerns are separated. It's a self-contained unit that in a bigger context can be reused to execute the same action/functionality over and over again.
Flexibility and reuseablity are the benefits of modules. 

## Components
A component, by definition, is a unit of composition. 
It the context of this css-framwork, a component is made up of multiple modules.
